# Plan A
An easy, safe and fast scripting language for Elasticsearch

# Get started
```
git clone git@github.com:elastic/Painless.git
cd Painless
./run.sh # unix
run.bat # windows
```

This starts a node on `localhost:9200` with `plan-a` language.
It takes a minute, it needs to build and test first.
